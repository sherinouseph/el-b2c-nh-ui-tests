Subject: www.efenglishtown.com is on live

1 – www.efenglishtown.com is visible now.
2 – direct visit to this domain in our office will be redirected to http://www.efenglishtown.com/es-us/lp/os/home/ (which shows 404 page now since it’s not there yet) (because we are logically in US).
3 – direct visit to this domain from other countries in the list should see these pages accordingly. For now you can add “ctr=XX” to mimic it.
de           /de-de/lp/os/home/
gb           /en-gb/lp/os/home/
ru            /ru-ru/lp/os/home/
sa            /ar-sa/lp/os/home/
it             /it-it/lp/os/home/
fr             /fr-fr/lp/oe/home/
tr             /tr-tr/lp/os/home/
jp            /ja-jp/lp/os/home/
us           /es-us/lp/os/home/
mx          /es-mx/lp/oe/home/
co           /es-co/lp/oe/home/
pe           /es-pe/lp/oe/home/
ve           /es-ve/lp/oe/home/
cl             /es-cl/lp/oe/home/
tw           /zh-tw/lp/oe/home/
4 – www.efenglishtown.com/robots.txt is showing whatever sent by Rosalba.
5 – Fwiw, I created these 2 pages for test purpose: www.efenglishtown.com?ctr=fr (with OE form on it) and www.efenglishtown.com?ctr=de  (with working OS flow on it, basic etag and partner tracking will be there but third party tracking will be lost as agreed in previous emails).
6 – other requests to the sites will be redirected to wherever the equivalent pages under the correct domain and path. E.g.
                http://www.efenglishtown.com/fr-fr/apprendre-l-anglais-en-ligne/ 
               will be redirected to 
               http://www.englishtown.fr/apprendre-l-anglais-en-ligne/
               for now. But after November 25th which is next Wednesday it will be redirected to 
               http://englishlive.ef.com/fr-fr/apprendre-l-anglais-en-ligne/
